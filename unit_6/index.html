					<h3 class="LittleHeaders">Jamaican Blue Mountain</h3>
					<p>Cultivated in the Jamaican Blue Mountains at a height of about 5,000 feet. This area is characterized by heavy rainfall and therefore, water supply is abundant. The beans are picked and processed here then sent around the globe. This drink has a characteristic mild taste that lacks bitterness.</p>
				</aside>
				<aside ID="Kona">
					<h3 class="LittleHeaders">Hawaiian Kona</h3>
					<p>Having a fantastic flavor and unique taste, this coffee is made of a rare variety of beans. In addition, this coffee is in short supply meaning MANY sellers use a blend of 10% Kona and 90% cheaper variety. To enjoy the complete Kona coffee experience, we brew nothing but 100% Kona roast.</p>

				<aside ID="SantaInes">
					<h3 class="LittleHeaders">Fazenda Santa Ines</h3>
					<p>Cultivated near the base of the Mantiquera mountains in Brazil, the production of Fazenda Santa Ines coffee beans dates back more than hundred years. This valuable coffee is patronized by a large number of people around the world and is valued for its fruity, sweet flavor.</p>
				</aside>
				<aside ID="Peaberry">
					<h3 class="LittleHeaders">El Injerto Peaberry</h3>
					<p>This varietal is grown in Gautemala and is processed by hand  by separating only small uniform beans known as “peaberry” for roasting. As it cools in your cup, expect subtle floral notes with strong citrus fruit flavors and wine like textures. It is one of the most highly coveted brews available.</p>

				<h2>The Legend</h2>
				<p class="subTitle1">The Guerilla Coffee Cart</p>
				<hr>
				<p>Joe's was originally operated as a "Guerilla Coffee Cart" on the Embarcadero in 1972.</p> 

				<p>After 10 years, and many a trip to the Caribbean, Joe finally set up a brick and mortar cafe in Oakland in 1985. He kept the Coffee Cart going as locals loved their Blue Mtn Coffee on their way to work.</p>
				<p>...And Blue Mountain Joe's has been a legend ever since...</p>
